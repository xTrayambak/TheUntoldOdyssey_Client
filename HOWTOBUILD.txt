TUO comes with a built-in build manager.
Run this in order to build the game for your platform:

python3 build.py

And press enter, the script will download the dependencies automatically and compile the game to your platform's executable and other executables like MacOS' .app and Windows' .exe.
If you encounter errors whilst building your application, run:

python3 main.py

to run the source code itself, it'll be the same client, just not compiled. It won't affect anything.
