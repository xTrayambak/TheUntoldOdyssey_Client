Oh, look, the "player" is here.
Let's call it by it's name.
Ah, alright.
Oh, look, "{}" is here.
It seems that it has defeated the "ultimate force of evil".
Yes.
Well, what does it do now?
For now, it's just floating in an empty void. We can't predict what's going to happen next.
Alright.
Should we tell it about it's origins now?
Yes.
Alright, now let me tell the story, of this player's existence.
When the world was being assembled, piece by piece, polygon by polygon, vertice by vertice, the player was assembled too, just like a lot more characters. 
But..
The player was different. It was not controlled by code for it's actions. It had a unique energy controlling it from outside the virtual universe. It was a human. An actual, living human.
The player curiously walked around, exploring things it had never seen before.
It ran.
It jumped.
It dashed.
Yes.
It set up temporary places to live.
It cooked food for survival.
It survived.
It thrived.
It fought battles, many of which it lost, and many of which it won.
It fought battles with both characters controlled by code and characters controlled by humans just like it.
Sometimes, the player thought.
It thought of green meadows, infinitely spanning across every direction it's eye could possibly see. 
It thought of birds chirping, and days full of sunshine.
It sometimes thought of disturbing things, but let's not get to that.
Yes.
It fought many "bosses", each unique with a set of powers.
It won, it lost, if it lost, it tried again. It did not give up.
I agree, it is a good player.
It has found success in this dream. But now, it must wake up to find success in the reality of life.
Wake up, {}.
You will be pushed back several times, but do know..
The world sees potential in you.
The world is going to help you.
The world loves you, if you love it back.
Go now, wake up.
