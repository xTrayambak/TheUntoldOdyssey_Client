Years ago, around 1000 years ago;
Lived a mighty soul who explored freely of the world,
A soul with family, with love, with freedom.
Not just one soul, millions of other souls.
It was a joyous life,
[I]But everything... was destroyed.
[I]Everything turned into ruins.
It was the work of indescribable monsters.
Hunting for pride,
Hunting for joy of its own,
Hunting on the lives of the innocent.
Families, loved ones, memories...
Were all lost.
It was a devastating time,
A devastating history.
But one mighty warrior,
Eager for revenge,
Eager for justice,
Was not any more patience.
[I]The warrior swore that day;
[I]They will banish these undeserving,
[S]Irrational, heartless, monsters.
Who take away,
But not give.
Who take away,
The happiness of others,
Just for their own joy and pleasure...
