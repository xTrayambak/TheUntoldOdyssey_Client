--- DO NOT TOUCH FILES HERE! ---

They may alter the game experience, break it completely or trigger Proximity ServerSided Anticheat onto you, causing a ban.

These are folders/files you may modify:

/img/
/logs/
/models/
/music/
/narrator_data/ (unless you have impaired vision)
/shaders/ (not recommended for people with epilepsy)
/textures/
/translations/
/sounds/
/fonts/
/dialogs/

Here are folders you should never, ever touch. If someone tells you to touch them, they are likely trying to grab your account or install malware onto your PC.
Syntax Studios support will never ask you for such things as we already have your SS account token.

/TOKEN (may get your account stolen)
/character.json (may trigger a false anticheat ban)
/settings.json (may brick the game, leading you to fully reinstall it, only change settings from the Settings Menu ingame)
/config.prc (Panda3D may misbehave, crash or simply not work if you mess around with how it tries to run TUO; if you mess with it, do not bug either Syntax Studios nor the Panda3D devs as it is your fault, reinstall.)
/cache/ (may contain your encryption key, can be used to decrypt sensitive data about your account)

We, Panda3D maintainers, or anyone in general is not responsible for any damage you inflict upon yourselves. We do not intend for you to change the game data in the first place, we are planning to implement datapacks soon.
Do not drag and drop things here as they may be malware.
