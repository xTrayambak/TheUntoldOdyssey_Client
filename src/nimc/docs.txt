This folder houses the compiled binaries/shared objects/dynamically linked libraries for the game's Nim code.

1) What is Nim?
First of all, use Wikipedia. Second of all, it's a statically-typed, compiled language that integrates very smoothly with Python.
Hence, we use it to write some intensive parts of the code in it as it's usually around 14x faster than Python as it turns into C code.

2) How can I compile these binaries myself?
First, install the Nim runtime and then, run the game. It will automatically install all libraries needed to build the Nim stuff.
Then, run this for every file in src/client that ends with the .nim extension.

```
nim c -d:release --app:lib --out:src/nimc/<PLATFORM YOU WANT TO BUILD FOR HERE [NT = WINDOWS, NIX = Linux&Mac]>/<FILE NAME HERE> --threads:on src/client/<FILE NAME HERE>
```

I recommend using -d:release as it removes the extra debug stuff and makes the execution faster.

Use .so for *NIX systems and .pyd for NT systems.

We describe Windows as the NT kernel, and *NIX as the collective of MacOS and Linux.
