# The Untold Odyssey, a OSS game currently in an alpha stage.

According to a poll conducted, people wanted the game client to be OSS (note: not FOSS, the game will cost around 5-10$).

# Basics
The Untold Odyssey, abbreviated as TUO, is a survival-camping RPG. It combines the aspects of my favorite games like World of Magic (by vetexgames on ROBLOX) and Celeste together with a very cool thing -- camping!
TUO can be played as a singleplayer game, or as multiplayer.
- In TUO, once you spawn into the game, you need to collect resources, build your very first shelter, a measly tent, and then survive the first night. Sleeping does not skip the night, it only fastens the night cycle.


# Technical Jibberish -- Building the game
To build the game into a standalone executable, view this. [https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/distribution/index]
Or, you can use the `deploy.py` script to do so automatically. (Just skip to the options until you get the build prompt)
